Please reference the instructable for more information on assembling the board.

Todo:
Software:
-Improve ECG Capture code
-Improve integration between the algorithm detection and sampling code
Hardware:
-Lipo charger circuit does not allow for the board to be powered while charging the LED, need to find a solution for this. Integrated charger?
